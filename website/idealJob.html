          <p>  This ideal job appeals to me strongly as it requires persistence, problem-solving and is extremely flexible with job opportunities across the globe.</p>

          <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56265605?type=standard#sol=c96cc10d5ebf8765a7f5c37d0f523c979c1e8dcb"><img src="images/idealjobss.jpg" alt="Penetration Tester Job Ad" height="850" width="690" style=margin-left:0px>

          <p>  The role of a penetration tester consists of taking a proactive and offensive approach to perform attacks into a company&rsquo;s or person&rsquo;s existing digital infrastructure. This consists of using different methods and tools to try and find vulnerabilities that a hacker could exploit and potentially lead to potential data breaches or loss of revenue (whether that be intellectual property, stored financial data, or just simple downtime due to a malicious hack).</p>
          <p>  Although there is generally no official needed qualifications to become a penetration tester &ndash; there are undoubtedly advantageous industry certifications to hold, such as:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left:26px;">
    <li>  CISA Certification - Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</li>
    <li>  CEH - Certified Ethical Hacker</li>
    <li>  CREST Certification</li>
    <li>  CISM - Certified Information Security Manager</li>
    <li>  Plus, many more different options</li>
</ul>
<p>  These certifications can generally be obtained by sitting a test with the relevant agency.</p>
<p>  As for the skills required for this job, there are many. A successful penetration tester should have a vast knowledge of scripting and coding, exploits and vulnerabilities, networks and infrastructure, web applications, operating systems, and firewalls. A successful penetration tester should also demonstrate critical thinking and outside-of-the-box problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>  To gain these skills and qualifications, I first plan on completing my Bachelor of Information &amp; Technology to better understand the whole field of IT before delving deeper into the world of cybersecurity. I currently also spend my free time learning more about penetration testing and hacking methods by watching YouTube videos, participating in forums, and listening to podcasts.</p>
