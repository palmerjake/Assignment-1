          <p>My interests in IT vary in all corners of the field. Growing up in the early 2000’s parallel to the technological boom has just been second nature to me. I have not known anything entirely different and have always kept up to date with the latest trends. In particular, I have always enjoyed pulling electronics apart and challenging myself to put them back together. Doing this from an early age has directed my interests into learning how things work and how they were created. This proceeded into wanting to learn more and more, not just about hardware, but the software and the impact IT has on the world.</p>
          <p>I was always the kid that tried to find a way around things to gain access to what I wanted. Whether this being “modding” my consoles to play any game, finding avenues such as proxies to access websites that were blocked in school or the earlier days, simply unplugging the home phone out of line so I would have uninterrupted access to the good old dial-up without my parents knowing!</p>
          <p>Most of my IT experience is self-taught – spending hours on end tinkering, watching YouTube, or browsing through forums. My senior years of high school included a 2-year traineeship obtaining a Certificate III in Media. I was very passionate about this for several years and envisioned that this would be what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. This, however, did wear thin and I lost interest.</p>
          <p>After getting a taste for money with a job while in high school, I decided to put off university; in doing so, I continued between a few jobs getting higher pay as my resume became longer. I am now at a point in my life where I’m tired of working a job. I want a career.</p>
          <p> I chose Open Universities Australia as my study method as the flexibility suits my current lifestyle. I also chose this education provider, as the university of choice for this course was RMIT, who are leaders in this space.</p>
          <p>During my studies with RMIT, I expect to gain an understanding across all fields within the world of IT. Upon completion, I hope to have gained a vast array of knowledge and narrow down a particular area that has sparked my interest to further focus on developing a career.</p>
